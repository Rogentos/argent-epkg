			Usage: epkg command [package(s)]

			epkg is a simple wrapper around portage, gentoolkit, and portage-utils that provides an
			apt-get/yum-alike interface to these commands, to assist people transitioning from
			Debian/RedHat-based systems to Gentoo.

			Commands [equivalent Gentoo command]:
				install - Install new packages
				remove - Remove packages safely
				forceremove - *Unsafely* remove packages
				autoremove - Remove packages that are no longer needed
				search - Search for packages
				upgrade - resync portage configs && upgrade installed packages
				clean - Remove old binary packages from packages dir
				cleanall - Remove all binary packages from packages dir
				list - List the files belonging to a package
				listall - List ALL installed packages
				check - Check a packages installed files match the checksum and timestamp they had when first installed
				checkall - Same as above, but against all installed packages
				provides - List the installed package(s) which own the indicated file
				sysinfo - Display information about installed core packages and portage configuration
