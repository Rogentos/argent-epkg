			Usage: epkg command [package(s)]

			epkg is a simple wrapper around portage, gentoolkit, and eix that provides an
			apt-get/yum-alike interface to these commands, to assist people transitioning from
			Debian/RedHat-based systems to Gentoo.

			Commands [equivalent Gentoo command]:
			    install - Install new packages [emerge -av package(s)]
			    remove - Remove packages safely [emerge --depclean -av packages(s)]
			    update - Retrieve updated kogaion portage configs [kogaionsync]
			    upgrade - Update installed packages [emerge -NDuav --with-bdeps=y @system world]
			    search - Search for packages [eix package]
			    autoremove - Remove packages that are no longer needed [emerge --depclean -a]
			    forceremove - *Unsafely* remove packages [emerge --unmerge -av package(s)]
			    list - List the files belonging to a package [qlist package]
			    listall - List ALL installed packages [qlist -ICv package]
			    provides - List the installed package(s) which own the indicated file [qfile file]
			    check - Check a package's installed files match the checksum and timestamp they had when first installed [qcheck package]
			    checkall - Same as above, but against all installed packages [qcheck]
			    sysinfo - Display information about installed core packages and portage configuration [emerge --info]

			You can pass arbitrary parameters to us after the command you want, and we'll
			forward them on to the underlying command.

			See epkg(1), emerge(1), equery(1), eix(1), and eclean(1) for more information.

			We immediately bought some hats so we'd blend in.
