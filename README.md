In order to compile:

`go get fyne.io/fyne/v2`

or

`go mod tidy`

then

`go build -o epkg-go ./cmd/main.go`

In order to run it needs sudo to install packages for the moment:

`sudo ./epkg-go`

Requirements to build:
* dev-lang/go-1.23 or above

Requirements to run successfully:
* Gentoo or Argent
* Argent EPKG

Need: UI/UX artists. This UI is terrible for the moment.
